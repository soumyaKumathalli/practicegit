design-
1]design pattern :POM-WEB UI automation
2]test layer-testNG
3]util/libs/generic functions:elementutil/jsutil/excelutil
4]3rd party libs:Sel ,WBM,testng,reports
5]HTML report-extent report,allure report,testng html report
6]Testng listeners
7]loggers-log4j
8]test data:data driven approach:properties,testNG parameters:data providers/excel sheet
9]config properties:	QA/dev/stg/prod
10]page chaining model 

framewrok-means seggregation of multiple components and intergating the usecase 


advantages of framework-
1]diff layers
2]maintenance
3]hard coded will be rmeoved
4]geenric FW
5]duplicate code




POM-its only applicable for web automation and mobile automation because we they have  multiple pages
2] so each page in one java class,another page in another java class 


1]page layer-
a]loginpage-it tells the behaviour and all the elements in the login page will be present in that or not
->the locators should be private
->page actions-like click,sendkeys
->actions has to be done by page layer like waht to do and all 


2]Driver factory -webdriver
a]initdriver	


3]config-properties
1]where we keep the browser and url information ,username and passowrd instead of hardcoding it


4]Test layer-testNG
a]where login page test using @Test annotation-so for each ans every java class a test class will be created
b]and assertion
c]********************dont use driver class here like driver.findelement***********************this is written in page layer




5]Base class where driver will be given to test class-then page class->
precondition means-parent for the test 
means extend the base class  where all the methods are available to run before and after using @before and @after etc
->where in turn it will call the driver factory becuase like opening url and enter userna,e and password whihc is precondition for driver
